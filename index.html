<p>Hey this is cool</p>
<p>There are two broad categories of tags though html 5 actually has 7 such categories.
<br>They are Block-level elements and Inline elements. The block level elements start on next line and even have  a line break at end of line 
<br>The inline elements start on same line</p>
<div>The Div is a basic block level element</div>
<span>The Span is a inline element</span>
<span>There can be multiple spans on a single line</span>
